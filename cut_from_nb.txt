## What is this python "interpreter"? 

... indeed, since the python language is well specified (meaning that there are clear rules about which command is supposed to do what), anyone (very) motivated can write a program able to execute a python program. In practice, there aren't that many alternative implementations of the python language, but let's name a few of them:
- [Cpython](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CPython): the reference implementation of the language (and the one you are using), written in C
- [Jython](http://www.jython.org/): a Java implementation, useful to run programs written in both languages
- [PyPy](https://pypy.org/): another implementation aiming at speeding the execution of your programs in certain circumstances.

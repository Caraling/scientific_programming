The test suite must contain unit tests for each function you programmed (I myself wrote 4 functions for exercise #02 and 3 for exercise #03). While doing so, you might find it very useful to refactor your code following the [good practices](09-Good-practices.ipynb): write small functions with a task clearly defined, which you can test for. If you can't test it, the function is possibly not written the right way: either too broad, or not useful enough.\n",

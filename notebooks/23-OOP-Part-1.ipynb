    "[Object-oriented programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming) (OOP) is a standard feature of many modern programming languages. Learning the main concepts of OOP would occupy one entire lecture at least, and we won't try to cover all the details here. The specific objectives of these two OOP units are:\n",
    "- learn the basic OOP concepts syntax so that you are able to *understand* code and libraries making use of it\n",
    "- become familiar with certain semantics associated with OOP: classes, objects, attributes, methods, etc.\n",
    "- introduce simple examples where OOP is a useful paradigm, and try to raise your interest in its usage so that you can learn it by yourself when needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "This first OOP unit introduces the concept of \"objects\" in the Python language and shows you how to make objects on your own. Next week's unit will tell you what objects are useful for."

    "As stated in the [OOP wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming), OOP is a \"paradigm\" which might or might not be supported by a specific programming language. Although Python is an OOP language as it very core, **it does not enforce its usage**: OOP is not a necessity. There are often more than one possible way to structure your program, using objects or using functions only. In fact, many of you will be able to write your master thesis and even your PhD thesis without *programming* in OOP on your own. You have, however, already made heavy use of Python objects (*everything* is an object in Python, remember?) and I think it is very important that you are able to understand the basics of it in order to make better use of Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "In short, OOP is simply *another* way to structure your programs. Until now, you have written modules consisting mainly of functions, sometimes with a short ``__main__`` script which was itself calling one or more functions. OOP will add a new tool to your repertoire by allowing you to **bundle data and behaviors into individual objects**, possibly helping you to organize your code in a way that feels more natural and organized.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's get started with some examples and new semantics! We will talk about the advantages and disadvantages of OOP in the following unit, once you are more familiar with its syntax."

    "**Inheritance** is a core concept of OOP. It allows a **child class** to override or extend methods and attributes from a **parent class**.

Let's make the ``Cat`` and ``Dog`` class inherit from the ``Pet`` class:"

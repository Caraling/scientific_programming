    "[SRTM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shuttle_Radar_Topography_Mission) is a digital elevation model at ~90 m resolution covering almost the entire globe (up to $\\pm$ 60° latitude). The data is organized in 5°x5° tiles. To see a map of the tiles have a look at [this download page](http://srtm.csi.cgiar.org/srtmdata/). This tool is nice to use if you know which tile you want, but not very useful if you want more than one tile at different places of the globe.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fortunately, the entire dataset is available on this server: http://srtm.csi.cgiar.org/wp-content/uploads/files/srtm_5x5/TIFF/\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to protect from naive \"download all\" behavior, the files stored here cannot be listed (i.e. automated data scraping won't work). Fortunately for us , the file naming convention is very simple:\n",
    "- example file: http://srtm.csi.cgiar.org/wp-content/uploads/files/srtm_5x5/TIFF/srtm_39_04.zip\n",
    "- the first two digits number gives the location of the tile in the longitudes (starting at 180° West)\n",
    "- the last two digits gives the location of the tile in the latitudes (starting at 60° North and going southwards)\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some examples of locations and their associated tile:\n",
    "- (-179, 59) -> 'srtm_01_01.zip'\n",
    "- (-179, 51) -> 'srtm_01_02.zip'\n",
    "- (-174, 54) -> 'srtm_02_02.zip'\n",
    "- (-180, 60) -> 'srtm_01_01.zip' (upper-left corner case)\n",
    "\n",
    "And so forth.\n",
    "\n",
    "**A. Write a script which, given a longitude and a latitude as arguments, downloads the corresponding file** in the current directory. The function should raise an error when the given location is not valid. \n",
    "\n",
    "*Hint A1: define \"valid\" locations first: some are easy to catch, some cannot be caught automatically. Do we really have to deal with those?*\n",
    "\n",
    "*Hint A2: unlike last week where we asked for user input, here I'm asking for a script with [command line arguments](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/stdlib.html?highlight=sys%20argv#command-line-arguments). That is, the command `%run download_srtm.py 9 44` (in an ipython interpreter) should download the file as expected.*\n",
    "\n",
    "**B.** Extend this script to be a bit more clever: **download the data file only if the file isn't already available in the current directory**. This is particularly useful because the server is not very fast. \n",
    "\n",
    "**C.** Extend this script to be even more clever: **given a range of longitudes and latitudes, it should download all the files covering this area**. For example, the range 9°W to 18°W and 44°N to 47°N would download 6 files. **In order to avoid manual mistakes, warn the user by announcing the number of files that the command is going to download, and ask for confirmation before going on** (by using the `input()` function). \n",
    "\n",
    "*Hint C1: the command should now be `%run download_srtm.py 9 44 18 47`.*\n",
    "\n",
    "**D.** Let's add more functionality to our script:\n",
    "\n",
    "- print a message to the user announcing if the file was downloaded or was already on disk\n",
    "- print the size of the file after download - choose [an appropriate unit](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UnitsPolicy) for the text\n",
    "- if the user asks for a plot, write a plot to disk with the file name `srtm_39_04.png` (if the tile 39, 4 was asked for). The user may ask for a plot by adding a `--plot` to the list of arguments. Note that `--plot` could be at any location in the argument list, i.e. `%run download_srtm.py 9 44 --plot 18 47` is a valid command and creates 6 plot files\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is a template for your plotting function:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# This is some real magic: we open the file from within the zip\n",
    "f = 'zip://srtm_39_04.zip!srtm_39_04.tif'\n",
    "plt.figure()\n",
    "with xr.open_rasterio(f) as da:\n",
    "    da.sel(band=1).plot.imshow(cmap='terrain', vmin=0)\n",
    "    plt.ylabel('Lat (°)'); plt.xlabel('Lon (°)'); plt.title('srtm_39_04'); \n",
    "plt.savefig('srtm_39_04.png')\n",
    "plt.close()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "No need to add more options than that: we haven't talked about these libraries yet! Just make sure that the filename is set to the correct value.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Note: you'll need the matplotlib, xarray and rasterio libraries installed for this to work (on your laptop: `conda install matplotlib xarray rasterio`). Also, I'm not sure this is going to work on Windows. If it doesn't, then you might have to extract the file from the zip before plotting it.*"
